README

This was a minor case revision to attempt to address some issues in the v1 case

1) Enable printing of the buttons without support material
2) Do away with the annoying stick out clips and their corresponding mating holes that never worked
3) Make the part easier to print by changing the geometry in the air vent area.

Known Issues
1) It got a little bit bulkier and more boxy (not sure if this is good or bad)
2) We now use 3d printing filament to retain the buttons - this got a bit finicky but does work with some persistance.
